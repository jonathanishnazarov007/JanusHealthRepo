# Project Name

Automation testing using cypress to test amazon website features

# Steps to Setup

- Install NodeJS, Cypress
- create a new project and type 'npx cypress open' in cmd at current folder path (This will create all required files to automate the process)
- Run cart.cy.ts in Cypress



# What if
- if i had more time I would extract constants from my test and store them in the component file
- if i had more time I would fix the auto-import issue ( i had to manually type in import and export) 
- if i had more time I would finish writing all tests since the most time consuming process is not the logic for tests but making tests reusable and reliable
- Also one of the issue was everytime you restart your test and try to login amazon would give you a "verify you are not a robot" test, which will fail my test unless i would manually complete this verification and restart the test.

Thank you
